Ya, I am working on that.
I expect this will require
several lost hours and rewrites.

Have a base object called
abstract XBase{
//with variables
XBase[] bases;
Collection<XAction> states;

public XBase(XBase...bases){
this.bases = bases;
}

//with functions
public void done(XAction a){
this.states.add(a)
}
}
enum XAction{
    POWERED,
    HEATED,
    ECT,
}
